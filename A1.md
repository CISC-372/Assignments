In this assignment, we will practice several typical data manipulation techniques. 
You are not supposed to remmeber all the APIs. Even myself has to Google/StackOverflow all the time with my tiny brain.
But in a lot of cases, there are many different ways to do the same thing. 
The purpose of this assignment is for you to see a cleaner version of the API usage, and to understand several different data related concepts (by Googling.

Learning objective:
- Practice using Google.
- Practice reading/understanding API documentations, which has became a critical skill in Data Science. 

If you prefer having a book as reference:
- [Panda example references](https://riptutorial.com/Download/pandas.pdf) (some of the examples are not very clean)
- [A scikit-learn guide](http://www.smallake.kr/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mastering-Machine-Learning-with-scikit-learn.pdf)

Delivery:
- A step-by-step Jupyter notebook with your answers to the questions.

### Environment Setup

1. Open a Google Colab notebook or a Jupyter notebook on your laptop. If it is on your local machine, please also install pandas and scikit-learn by:
```
conda activate your_372_environment # this may be different depending on your system & assumes that you have created an environment
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
```
2. In the first cell, run the code below to make sure everything is okay without any errors:

```python
import pandas
import sklearn
print(pandas.__version__)
print(sklearn.__version__)
print('alright I am done. this is too easy for me.')
```

Question: describe which option you use and what is your setup.

### Data Loading 

1. This is the link to our [csv file ](https://github.com/CISC-372/Assignments/releases/download/a1/train.csv)
2. Download the file and try to load it into a panda dataframe using its path. If you use Google Colab, you need to upload the file to the folder tree panal on the left. 
```python
import pandas as pd # we already did but usually people use pd as its abbreviation.
df = pd.read_csv(your_csv_file_path) # df usually is the abbreviation for `data frame` (like a table)
```
3. We can also load the file directly from url:
```python
import pandas as pd # we already did but usually people use pd as its abbreviation.
df = pd.read_csv('https://github.com/CISC-372/Assignments/releases/download/a1/train.csv')
```
4. Let's inspect some data.
```python
print(df)
```
5. Next, we will try out some APIs to explore the dataset (you may want to do it one-by-one). Describe what you see and what is your interepretation of each of them.
```python
df.describe() # run this in a seperate cell then the notebook will put the result into a nice table
print(df.columns)
print(df.columns[0])
print(df.describe())
```

### Data Manipulation

Try out the following commands, and describe what are your interpretations.

1. Select a/some column[s]:
```python
df.bathrooms
df.bathrooms.describe()
df[['bathrooms', 'bedrooms']]
df[['bathrooms', 'bedrooms', 'beds', 'guests_included']].describe()
```
2. Select a/some row[s]:
```python
df.iloc[1]
df.iloc[2]
df.iloc[2:10]
df.iloc[[1,3,4,9,19,45]]
df.iloc[[1,3,4,9,19,45]].describe()
```
3. Select rows based on certain conditions:
```python
df.loc[df['beds'] > 3] 
df.loc[(df['bedrooms'] > 3) & (df['beds'] > 3)] 
df.loc[df['bedrooms'] > df['beds']] 
df.loc[df['

```
1. Select some rows based on the condition:
```python
df.loc[df['beds'] > 3] 
df.loc[(df['bedrooms'] > 3) & (df['beds'] > 3)] 
df.loc[df['bedrooms'] > df['beds']]
```
