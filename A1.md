In this assignment, we will practice several basic data manipulation techniques. 
You are not supposed to remmeber all the APIs. Even myself has to Google/StackOverflow all the time.
But in a lot of cases, there are many different ways to do the same thing. 
The purpose of this assignment is for you to see a cleaner version of the APIs, and to understand several different data related concepts (by Googling.

Learning objective:
- Practice using Google.
- Practice reading/understanding API documentations, which has became a critical skill in Data Science. 

If you prefer having a book as reference:
- [Panda example references](https://riptutorial.com/Download/pandas.pdf) (some of the examples are not very clean)
- [A scikit-learn guide](http://www.smallake.kr/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mastering-Machine-Learning-with-scikit-learn.pdf)

#### Data Manipulation

First, open a Google Colab notebook or a Jupyter notebook on your laptop.
